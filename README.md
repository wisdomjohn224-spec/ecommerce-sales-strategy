Project: E-commerce Sales Strategy & Optimization

🎯 Executive Summary

This project analyzes Q2 sales data for a growing e-commerce retailer to identify key drivers of revenue and inform a high-impact Q3 growth strategy. Analysis utilized SQL to segment data by product, geography, and customer value. The core finding is a significant revenue opportunity in the Northeast region, driven by high sales of Product A. The proposed strategy shifts focus and budget to these high-return areas to achieve an immediate 15% growth target.

🛠️ Methodology: SQL Analysis

The analysis focused on three key areas of the Sales dataset:

Geographic Performance: Calculating total revenue for the top 4 regions.

Product Performance: Determining the top 5 products by total quantity sold.

Customer Segmentation: Identifying High-Value Customers (HVCs) who have spent over $1,000.

🔑 Key Findings

Metric

Result

Insight

Top Performing Region (Revenue)

Northeast ($15,100)

This region generates 40% of the total revenue, indicating the highest immediate potential for scaling.

Top Selling Product (Quantity)

Product A (Sold 55 units)

Product A is the most popular, representing a reliable volume driver across regions.

High-Value Customers (HVCs)

2 identified customers (Total Spend: $11,900)

HVCs contribute disproportionately to total revenue. Loyalty programs should target this segment.

🚀 Strategic Recommendations

Based on the data, I recommend a focused growth plan:

Targeted Regional Marketing: Immediately allocate 60% of the Q3 marketing budget to the Northeast region. Focus promotional efforts specifically on maximizing sales velocity of Product A within that region.

Develop HVC Loyalty Program: Create a dedicated loyalty tier for High-Value Customers (those spending over $1,000). Offer early access to new products or exclusive discounts to maintain retention and increase their Lifetime Value (LTV).

Cross-Sell Strategy: Use the Product A sales data to identify complementary products and implement an automated cross-sell campaign at the checkout page to increase the Average Order Value (AOV).
